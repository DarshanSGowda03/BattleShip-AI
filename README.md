This project implements a Python-based AI for the classic game of Battleship. The AI intelligently places ships and competes against human players or other AIs in a grid-based environment. Using strategic algorithms, the AI efficiently searches for and targets enemy ships, adapting its gameplay based on hits and misses. The project focuses on decision-making techniques, pattern recognition, and probability-based attack strategies to enhance the AI's performance. The entire implementation is built in pure Python, showcasing the application of AI to game logic and tactical decision-making in a turn-based game setting.
